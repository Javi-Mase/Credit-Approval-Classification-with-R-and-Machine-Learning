# Credit Approval Classification with R and Machine Learning

This repository contains the deliverables for a practical project in the "Machine Learning" course at the University of Murcia. The main goal is to develop a classification model using supervised learning techniques to analyze and classify the "Credit Approval" dataset from the UCI repository. The project involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and the training of multiple machine learning models using the caret library in R.

Key features of the project include:

Data Preprocessing: Handling missing values, feature engineering, and scaling.
Model Training: Comparing at least four different models, including neural networks and decision trees, with hyperparameter tuning.
Evaluation: Estimating model performance on test data and selecting the best-performing model based on accuracy and other metrics.
Deliverables: Comprehensive documentation (PDF/HTML), R scripts for reproducibility, and the final workspace.
This repository showcases practical applications of machine learning techniques and demonstrates proficiency in R programming.
